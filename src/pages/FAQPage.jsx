        a: 'Yes. Your cart can hold products from multiple sellers. On the Cart page, select the items you want (using checkboxes per item or per store) and the Order Summary will show a breakdown per store. When you checkout, a separate order is created for each seller automatically.',

        q: 'How does stock work? Can a product sell out while I\'m shopping?',
        a: 'Yes. Stock is reserved the moment you add a product to your cart. This means other buyers cannot purchase the same units you have reserved.

        q: 'How does stock management work?',
